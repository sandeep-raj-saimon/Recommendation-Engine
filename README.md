# Recommendation-Engine
Recommendation Engine are of 2 types:
  1. Content Based 
  2. Collaborative-Filtering
  
In the Content-Based Folder there are two programs which are independent of each other.
  program_1 is not user specific based
  program_2 is user specific based which makes use of profile vector for generating recommendation
  
In the Collaborative Filetring we use the concept of Restricted Boltzman Machine which is a type of Unsupervised learning algorithm.
We have input layer and hidden layer but no output layer.We input the data into Boltzmann machine. The model helps learn different connection between nodes and weights of the parameters
